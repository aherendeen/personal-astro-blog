				I’m [Your Name Here], a developer based in [Your Location Here]. I build
				practical, accessible websites for small businesses and teams — focused
				on clarity, performance, and maintainability.
			</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy designing usable interfaces and shipping reliable, well-tested
				code. I also consult with small teams on product strategy, operations,
				and web best practices, and write about development and product thinking
				on this blog.
